                <p style="text-align: justify;">My name is <b>Udbhav Makkar</b>, 19 years old. My hometown is Chandigarh, which is the <b>best city</b>, and when I say it is the <b>best city</b>, I mean it. I have done all my schooling from <b>Chandigarh</b> only. I have never studied computers earlier, so this is my first time here in <b>VIT</b> studying computer science.</p>
                
                <p style="text-align: justify;">I have completed one and a half years in this college, and the experience is <b>not that bad</b> honestly. I met a lot of people, some <b><i>black</i></b> and some <b><i>white</i></b>. My roommates are good, I am category 4 for the fees here in <b>VIT</b>, and I am a chill guy since childhood. I love playing guitar, and I love to sing along.</p>
                
                <p style="text-align: center;">I honestly don't know what else to write about myself here, but I will still write something so that I complete my <b>3 paragraphs</b>. I will tell you about my club now. I am just part of it right now, and I might become chair.</p>
